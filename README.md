### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Chengkai Wu. My interests lie in the fields of **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**, **Mobile Manipulators** and **Motion Planning**. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's degree in Automation at [Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen](http://en.hitsz.edu.cn/), China, under the guidance of [Jie Mei](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tyQm5IkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). In addition to this, since January 2023, I have been working as a research assistant at [SYSU-STAR](http://sysu-star.com) group, under the supervision of [Boyu Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=-fnyGY4AAAAJ). Previously, in 2022, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Engineering at [College of Electronic and Engineering](http://english.ee.xidian.edu.cn/index.html), [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/). I was a visiting student supervised by Dr. [Yanjun Cao](http://zju-fast.com/research-group/yanjun-cao/) at [FASTLab](http://zju-fast.com/) from 07/2021 to 09/2021. For more information, please visit my [Personal Website](https://ck1201.github.io/).

ðŸ’¬ I am actively seeking PhD opportunities in robotics, with a special focus on motion planning, commencing in Spring 2025.
